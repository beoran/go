# The GoTwo Programming Language

GoTwo is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build complex,
unreliable, and inefficient software. It is a friendly parody fork of the [Go language](http://golang.org).

Pull requests welcome. If the feature you want to implement actually works and doezn't break too many things, I'll probably merge it. Probably.
